## Metacommentary: Reading Group Structure

With the semester wrapping up, thoughts naturally turned to how the reading group will be run next semester.
One idea that was floated was more consistent theming in terms of paper focus by semester: web security one semester, binary analysis the next, then cryptography, etc.
Another idea was fewer but more in-depth presentations on related papers  in keeping with the renewed focus on discussion over paper summarization.
Single-topic semesters could mean that particularly interesting papers aren't selected for a while after publication, while more rigorous presentations on entire areas could avoid that pitfall and hopefully generate more discussion since presentations would have more context included.

Alternatively, at the start of the semester, the reading group as a whole could come up with a pool of papers to pull from over the course of the semester.
This has the advantage of hewing more closely to the preferences of whoever is actually participating, as well as giving the first week of class a bit more meat to it without needing to jump straight into presentations.

No word yet on which strategy will actually win out, but hopefully laying out the options being considered calms the anxious throng of devoted readers clamoring for clarity.
Stay tuned!
